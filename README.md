# Rocket-Launching-
This is the Open ended project designed by me in a Computer Graphics using Graphics liabraries
The rocket launching takes place from the ground... and a suggestion for improvement that wanted to be gotten done is the camera should be linked to the rocket and the ground should go down after launch. At present the ground just vanishes and sky color changes instantly. Then stars appear and the moon(mars according to the function in the program) goes past the rocket.
